# deepRL_stable_baselines
# Project Description
This project implements a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) solution for stock trading using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm from Stable Baselines3. The environment simulates stock trading decisions based on historical price data of a specified stock (in this case, AAPL). The implementation includes a custom OpenAI Gym environment tailored for trading tasks, where the agent learns to maximize profit by making buy, sell, or hold decisions.

# Key Features
Custom Gym Environment: Created specifically for stock trading with actions such as buying, selling, and holding stocks.

# PPO Algorithm: 
Utilizes the Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm from Stable Baselines3 for training.

# Training and Evaluation: 
Includes scripts for training the model on historical data and evaluating its performance on unseen test data.

# Visualization: 
Provides plotting functions to visualize rewards and profits over episodes during evaluation.
